# Personas — RiskPilot

## HR Manager
- **Goal:** triage contractors fast; avoid delays
- **Pain:** manual checks eat time; inconsistent reviewer judgment
- **Success:** clear score < 60s; shareable PDF
- **Top objection:** “Is this legally sufficient?” → It is a pre-check + audit note

## Compliance Analyst
- **Goal:** consistent rules + audit trail
- **Pain:** scattered notes; hard to prove diligence
- **Success:** rationale in a timestamped PDF; structured inputs
- **Top objection:** “Black box?” → Expose rules; include “Why” bullets

## Finance Ops
- **Goal:** reduce payout risk
- **Pain:** lacks context for holds/escalations
- **Success:** visible risk level before payout; admin KPIs to report upstream
- **Top objection:** “Will this slow us down?” → 60-second promise; admin exports
