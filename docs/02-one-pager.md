# One-Pager — RiskPilot

An admin dashboard tracks pilot KPIs so teams can prove value.

- Finance/Ops (payout risk context)

## Benefits
- **Time saved:** 80%+ faster than manual checks
- **Consistency:** transparent rules and rationale
- **Auditability:** PDF with timestamp and inputs
- **Evidence:** admin KPIs for adoption & usefulness

## Status
MVP live. Pilot ready with 5–10 users. Metrics captured automatically.
